## references:

- used [this site](https://www.iloveimg.com/resize-image/resize-svg) to resize svg's and saved them locally.
- read from [here](https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-use-svgs-in-react/) how to use svg in react.

## customize

- in order to offset SVG's change the svg.x and svg.y attribute.
- if needed, you can use [transforms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/transform) to achived desired look.
- xarrow headSize and tailSize still works as expected.
